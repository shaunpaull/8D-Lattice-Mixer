# 8D-Lattice-Mixer
8D Lattice Mixer

In this updated version, I've added two new functions: mixTransactions and mixLatticeIndex. The mixTransactions function takes an array of transaction indices and returns a new array with mixed indices for enhanced anonymity. It calls the mixLatticeIndex function for each transaction index to apply mixing to each dimension.

The mixLatticeIndex function performs mixing on a single lattice index by applying mixing to each dimension. The mixing is done by adding an offset to the index based on a random value generated from the index itself. This mixing process helps to obfuscate the relationship between the original indices and the mixed indices, enhancing the anonymity of the transactions.

Please note that the mixTransactions function is currently marked as view to indicate that it only reads data from the blockchain without modifying it. If you intend to perform actual transaction mixing, you may need to modify the contract to handle state changes accordingly.
